        CAT <<EOF > metadata.json
        {
            "Endpoint": "$ENDPOINT_URI",
            "CodeSigningAccountName": "$NAME",
            "CertificateProfileName": "$PROFILE_NAME"
        }
        EOF
        ```

### Compile .NET demo application (optional)

A simple C# Console application is provided in this repo to allow you to test code signing.
You can test using a different executable, this is only provided here for convenience.

Compile .NET application as follows:

```bash
cd dotnetapp
dotnet build
cd ..
```

### Use SignTool to sign executable file

Use the following command to sign the `dotnetapp.exe` compiled above:

```bash
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/bin/10.0.22621.0/x64/signtool sign \
//v //debug //fd SHA256 //tr http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com //td SHA256 \
//dlib Microsoft.Trusted.Signing.Client/bin/x64/Azure.CodeSigning.Dlib.dll \
//dmdf metadata.json dotnetapp/bin/Debug/net9.0/dotnetapp.exe
```

If successful you should see output similar to this:

```txt
Submitting digest for signing...

OperationId 65385c73-0834-4d7c-bd3c-ec96dc5457e9: InProgress

Signing completed with status 'Succeeded' in 11.5819863s

Successfully signed: dotnetapp/bin/Debug/net9.0/dotnetapp.exe

Number of files successfully Signed: 1
Number of warnings: 0
Number of errors: 0
```

To verify signature the following command can be used:

```bash
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/bin/10.0.22621.0/x64/signtool verify \
//pa dotnetapp/bin/Debug/net9.0/dotnetapp.exe
```

### Compile Java demo application (optional)

Download and install [JDK 17 or greater](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download).

Export `JAVA_HOME` variable (your JDK path may differ):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME='/c/Program Files/Eclipse Adoptium/jdk-21.0.2.13-hotspot'
```

A simple Java Spring Boot application is provided in this repo to allow you to test signing JAR files.
You can test using a different JAR file, this is only provided here for convenience.

Compile Java application as follows:

```bash
cd javademoapp
./mvnw package -DskipTests
cd ..
```

### Use jsign and Trusted Signing to sign executable file

**NOTE:** [jsign](https://ebourg.github.io/jsign/) is a third party tool not supported by Microsoft.

1. Download all-in-one `jsign` jar:

    ```bash
    curl -o jsign-7.1.jar https://github.com/ebourg/jsign/releases/download/7.1/jsign-7.1.jar
    ```

1. Get access token for code signing:

    ```bash
    ACCESS_TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource https://codesigning.azure.net \
    --query accessToken --output tsv)
    ```

1. Use command to sign executable:

    ```bash
    java -jar jsign-7.1.jar --storetype TRUSTEDSIGNING \
        --keystore $ENDPOINT_URI \
        --storepass $ACCESS_TOKEN \
        --alias $NAME/$PROFILE_NAME dotnetapp/bin/Debug/net9.0/dotnetapp.exe
    ```

1. Optionally, use `signtool` to verify signature the following command can be used:

```bash
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/bin/10.0.22621.0/x64/signtool verify \
//pa dotnetapp/bin/Debug/net9.0/dotnetapp.exe
```

#### Use jarsigner to sign a jar file

`jsign` does not directly support signing `jar` files, however this can be accomplished in conjunction with `jarsigner`, a program included in the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).

As a prerequisite, you first need to setup JRE keystore to trust Microsoft Root Certificate as explained in this [Github issue](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign/discussions/268).

1. Download [Microsoft Identity Verification Root Certificate Authority 2020.crt](http://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/Microsoft%20Identity%20Verification%20Root%20Certificate%20Authority%202020.crt)

    ```bash
    curl -o 'Microsoft Identity Verification Root Certificate Authority 2020.crt' \
    http://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/Microsoft%20Identity%20Verification%20Root%20Certificate%20Authority%202020.crt
    ```

1. Import Microsoft Root CA certificate into your JRE's `cacerts` file:

    ```bash
    sudo keytool -importcert -alias microsoft-identity-root-ca \
    -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts" -storepass changeit \
    -file "Microsoft Identity Verification Root Certificate Authority 2020.crt"
    ```

1. Provide sudo password if prompted and enter **yes** when prompted to trust certificate.

1. Sign the jar file using the command below:

    ```bash
    jarsigner -J-cp -Jjsign-7.1.jar -J--add-modules -Jjava.sql \
    -providerClass net.jsign.jca.JsignJcaProvider \
    -providerArg $ENDPOINT_URI -keystore NONE \
    -storetype TRUSTEDSIGNING -storepass $ACCESS_TOKEN \
    javademoapp/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar $NAME/$PROFILE_NAME 
    ```

1. Optionally to verify the jar file has been signed, use this command:

    ```bash
    jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs javademoapp/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

1. As a final verification step, you can optionally attempt to run the `jar` and confirm it is still functional:

    ```bash
    cd javademoapp
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
